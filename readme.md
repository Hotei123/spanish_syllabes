This code generates an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck of Spanish syllabes. It was mostly generated with Gemini. To generate the deck, first run _generate_images.py_ to generate the images, and then _generate_anki_deck.py_ to generate the deck file _spanish_syllabes.apkg_. After importing this deck in Ankidroid, remember to copy the images in _my_text_images_truetype_ inside the folder _collection.media_ in the Android device.
